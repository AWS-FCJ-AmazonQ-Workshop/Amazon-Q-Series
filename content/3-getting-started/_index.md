#### Getting Started with Amazon Q Developer

**Amazon Q Developer** is a generative AI assistant embedded in your IDE, designed to accelerate all phases of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). It helps you understand unfamiliar codebases, fix bugs, generate tests, and optimize AWS resources quickly and efficiently.

#### Key Features

#### Code Development Capabilities

- **Inline Code Completion**: Write code faster with real-time suggestions. Supports 15+ languages, including Java, Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, C#, Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, CDK, and more.

- **Chat Interface**: Generate, refactor, and explain code; ask questions about software development directly in your IDE with natural language conversations.

- **Code Analysis**: Detect and fix security vulnerabilities across more than 10 languages such as Java, Python, TypeScript, C#, JavaScript, Go, Ruby, and PHP.

- **Code Reference Log**: See attribution for code generated by Amazon Q that's similar to its training data, ensuring transparency and compliance.

#### Advanced AI Agents

- **Software Development Agent (/dev)**: Automatically plan and implement new features across multiple files in your workspace. This agent can understand your project structure and make coordinated changes across your codebase.

- **Code Transformation Agent (/transform)**: Instantly upgrade Java applications (Java 8/11 to Java 17 for Maven projects) in minutes, handling complex dependency updates and code modernization.
