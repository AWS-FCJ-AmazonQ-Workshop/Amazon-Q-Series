2. Click on **Extensions** on the left activity bar.

#### Authenticate

You have 2 options to sign-in and this workshop explores both the authentication methods:

1. with [Builder ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-visual-studio/latest/user-guide/builder-id.html) for Individual users with Free Tier
2. with [AWS IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-visual-studio/latest/user-guide/sso-credentials.html) for Professional users with Pro Tier

You might use a workforce identity in IAM Identity Center to represent your work-self and an AWS Builder ID to represent your private-self. These identities operate independently. [Amazon Q Developer Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/pricing/) for more details.

#### With AWS Builder ID (no AWS account required)

Choose this option to use Amazon Q for free. You do not need an AWS Account, however, you do need to sign up for an AWS Builder ID. [AWS Builder ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/sign-in-aws_builder_id.html) is a personal profile that provides access to [select tools and services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/aws_builder_id-apps.html). AWS Builder ID is free. You only pay for the AWS resources you consume in your AWS accounts, which is separate from Builder ID. You can use the same email for your AWS Builder ID and for the root user email of an AWS account.

1. Select on the first option "**Use for Free**" and click "**Continue**".

Ensure the Account Administrator shares two key items for you to login via Visual Studio Code:

- Start URL
