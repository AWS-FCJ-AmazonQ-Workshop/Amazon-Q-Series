In this section, you will get hands-on experience with how Amazon Q Developer helps detect and address security vulnerabilities directly during the coding process. With real-time security scanning, Q Developer automatically identifies common issues such as SQL injection, open redirect, path traversal, privilege escalation, and exposure of AWS credentials.

**You will practice step by step:**

- Detecting vulnerabilities as you write code
- Understanding the root cause and severity
- Receiving automated remediation suggestions that follow industry security best practices

#### Contents

**2.1** [Open Redirect Vulnerability](1-open-redirect-vulnerability/) - Unvalidated URL redirections

**2.2** [SQL Injection](2-sql-injection/) - Database query manipulation attacks

**2.3** [Improper Privilege Management](3-improper-privilege-management/) - Excessive permission assignments

**2.4** [Path Traversal](4-path-traversal/) - Unauthorized file system access

**2.5** [OS Command Injection](5-os-command-injection/) - System command execution attacks

**2.6** [AWS Credentials Logged](6-aws-credentials-logged/) - Sensitive credential exposure

#### Prerequisites

- **Amazon Q Developer installed** in your IDE (Visual Studio Code recommended)
- **Amazon Q Developer Pro subscription** for Auto Scan features (or Free tier for Project Scans)
- **Basic Python knowledge** for understanding code examples
- **Active AWS account** for Amazon Q Developer authentication
- **IDE workspace** set up for creating and testing vulnerable code samples

Through real-world scenarios, you will become familiar with the process of checking, assessing, and fixing security vulnerabilities, helping you write safer code right from the development stage.
