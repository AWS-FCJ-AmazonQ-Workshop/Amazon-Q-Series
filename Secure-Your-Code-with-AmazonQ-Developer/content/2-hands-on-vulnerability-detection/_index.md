In this section, you will get hands-on experience with how Amazon Q Developer helps detect and address security vulnerabilities directly during the coding process. With real-time security scanning, Q Developer automatically identifies common issues such as SQL injection, open redirect, path traversal, privilege escalation, and exposure of AWS credentials.

**You will practice step by step:**

- Detecting vulnerabilities as you write code
- Understanding the root cause and severity
- Receiving automated remediation suggestions that follow industry security best practices

Through real-world scenarios, you will become familiar with the process of checking, assessing, and fixing security vulnerabilities, helping you write safer code right from the development stage.
