In this workshop we understood how to use Amazon Q Developer to detect security policy violations and vulnerabilities in your code with static application security testing (SAST), secrets detection, and infrastructure as code (IaC) scanning. Security scans in Amazon Q identify security vulnerabilities and suggest how to improve your code.

Incorporating security tools like Amazon Q into the development environment, especially within the Integrated Development Environment (IDE), offers significant advantages for maintaining high security and code quality standards. Here are a few:

Real-Time Detection: By analyzing code in real-time as it's written, developers receive immediate feedback on potential vulnerabilities, coding standards violations, and even simple syntax errors. This instant feedback loop encourages learning and correction on the spot, rather than after the fact.

Early Vulnerability Detection: Identifying vulnerabilities early in the development process significantly reduces the costs and effort required to fix them later. Early detection means security issues can often be resolved before the code is merged into the main codebase, much less deployed to production.

Better Code Practices: With suggestions on how to improve code or remediate vulnerabilities, developers learn best practices in real-time. This not only improves the security of the current project but also enhances the developer's overall coding skills.

Reduced Remediation Time: Fixing issues in the development phase is significantly cheaper and faster than addressing them in later stages, such as after deployment.

Keep practising with Amazon Q and leveraging the power of AI to help you improve in your security journey.
