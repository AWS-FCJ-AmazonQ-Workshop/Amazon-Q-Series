You can build a library of common prompts that you can use when chatting with Amazon Q in the IDE. By storing these prompts in your library, you can easily insert them into the chat without having to retype the prompt each time. You can use saved prompts across multiple conversations and projects.

Prompts are saved in the _~/.aws/amazonq/prompts_ folder.

#### Why Use Security Prompt Library?

**In this security workshop, the prompt library helps to:**

- Consistently analyze 6 main types of vulnerabilities
- Save setup time for each lab exercise
- Ensure the quality of security assessments
- Focus on remediation instead of writing prompts

#### Benefits of Standardized Security Prompts

**For Individual Developers**

- Faster security reviews with pre-built, tested prompts
- Comprehensive coverage ensuring no vulnerability types are missed
- Learning tool to understand security best practices
- Consistent quality in security assessments

**For Development Teams**

- Shared security standards across all team members
- Onboarding efficiency for new developers
- Code review consistency using the same security criteria
- Knowledge sharing through documented security practices

**For Organizations**

- Scalable security processes across multiple projects
- Audit trail of security assessments performed
- Compliance support with documented security reviews
- Risk reduction through systematic vulnerability detection

By the end of this section, you'll have a comprehensive security prompt library that can be used across all your development projects to maintain consistent security standards and accelerate vulnerability detection.
