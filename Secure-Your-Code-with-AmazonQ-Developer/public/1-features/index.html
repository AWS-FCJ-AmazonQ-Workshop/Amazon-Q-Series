	<p>Amazon Q Developer is available across AWS environments and services, and also as a coding assistant in third party IDEs.</p>
<p>Many of Amazon Q Developer’s capabilities exist in a chat interface, where you can use natural language to ask questions about AWS, get help with code, explore resources, or troubleshoot. When you chat with Amazon Q, Amazon Q uses the context of your current conversation to inform its responses. You can ask follow-up questions or refer to its response when you ask a new question.</p>
<p>Other Amazon Q Developer features are available as a part of your workflows in AWS service consoles and supported IDEs. The following sections explain the different features of Amazon Q Developer that you might encounter across your AWS experience.</p>
<h3 id="migration--transfer">Migration &amp; Transfer</h3>
<h4 id="amazon-q-developer-transformation-web-experience">Amazon Q Developer transformation web experience</h4>
<p>Amazon Q Developer’s transformation capabilities can help your enterprise discover, plan, and execute migration and modernization jobs for your legacy applications running on-premises or in the cloud.</p>
<h3 id="analytics">Analytics</h3>
<h4 id="summarizing-your-data">Summarizing your data</h4>
<p>With Amazon Q Amazon QuickSight, you can utilize the Generative BI authoring experience, create executive summaries of your data, ask and answer questions of data, and generate data stories.</p>
<h3 id="management-and-governance">Management and governance</h3>
<h4 id="exploring-nodes-using-text-prompts">Exploring nodes using text prompts</h4>
<p>Using AWS Systems Manager and Amazon Q, you can ask natural language questions about your managed nodes or instances. Amazon Q then uses the Systems Manager ListNodes action and creates filters based on your textual input to retrieve results.</p>
<h4 id="investigating-operational-issues-preview">Investigating operational issues (preview)</h4>
<p>Amazon Q Developer operational investigations enhance your ability to investigate and analyze resources, events, and activities across your AWS environment. By leveraging natural language processing, Amazon Q simplifies the process of understanding complex scenarios and relationships within your AWS account.</p>
<p>Amazon Q Developer now helps you accelerate operational investigations across your AWS environment. Q looks for anomalies in your telemetry, surfaces related signals for you to explore, identifies potential root-cause hypothesis, and suggests next steps to help you remediate issues faster.</p>
<p>By integrating Amazon Q into your investigative workflows, you can accelerate problem solving, enhance your understanding of your AWS environment, and make more informed decisions about your infrastructure and applications.</p>

<div class="notices note" ><p>The Amazon Q operational investigations feature is in preview release and is subject to change.</p>
</div>

<h4 id="taking-inventory-of-your-aws-resources">Taking inventory of your AWS resources</h4>
<p>You can ask Amazon Q about your specific AWS account resources from anywhere in the AWS Management Console. You might not know where to locate relevant information about your resources, or you might be in one service console and want to access information about another service’s resources without disrupting your workflow.</p>
<p>Amazon Q Developer answers your natural language questions about resources and provides deep links to those resources so you can quickly find them. You can ask Amazon Q to list a type of resource in your account, for details about a specific resource, or to list resources based on a criteria such as region or state.</p>
<p>For example, you may want to know how many Amazon EC2 instances you currently have running. In that case, you can ask Amazon Q your question in natural language, and it will provide an answer based on your specific resources.</p>
<h4 id="use-amazon-q-in-the-aws-console-mobile-application">Use Amazon Q in the AWS Console Mobile Application</h4>
<p>Amazon Q is integrated with the AWS Console Mobile Application to answer questions about AWS. You configure access the same way that you get access to Amazon Q in the AWS Management Console.</p>

<h3 id="compute">Compute</h3>
<h4 id="choosing-amazon-elastic-compute-cloud-instances">Choosing Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances</h4>
<p>With so many Amazon EC2 instance types available, finding the right instance types for your workload can be time-consuming and complex. The Amazon Q instance type selector considers your use case, workload type, CPU manufacturer preference, and how you prioritize price and performance, as well as additional parameters that you can specify. It then uses this data to provide suggestions and guidance for Amazon EC2 instance types that are best suited to your new workloads.</p>
<p><img alt="ec2-instance-type-finder" src="//localhost:1313/images/1/ec2-instance-type-finder.gif?width=90pc"></p>

<p><img alt="q-dev-smstudio" src="//localhost:1313/images/1/q-dev-smstudio.png?width=90pc"></p>
<h4 id="interacting-with-the-command-line-and-aws-cloudshell">Interacting with the command line and AWS CloudShell</h4>
<h5 id="command-line-interface-cli">Command Line Interface (CLI)</h5>
<p>After installing Amazon Q for the command line, you can use it to complete CLI commands as it populates contextually relevant subcommands, options and arguments. It provides AI-generated completions as you type in the command line. Additionally, you can use Amazon Q to write natural language instructions that are instantly translated to an executable shell code snippet. You can also ask Amazon Q complex questions, and it provides feedback and instructions based on the conversation, as well as context and information outside of the conversation. You can then provide permission to Amazon Q so it performs actions on your behalf. With multi-language support, you can chat with Amazon Q in any of the supported natural languages, including English, Mandarin, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, Korean, Hindi and Portuguese, with more languages available.</p>
<h4 id="aws-cloudshell">AWS CloudShell</h4>

<h3 id="application-integration">Application integration</h3>
<h4 id="writing-scripts-to-automate-aws-services">Writing scripts to automate AWS services</h4>
<p>You may know exactly what to do with your AWS resources, and you may find yourself taking the same actions repeatedly. In that case, you can ask Amazon Q to write code that will automate the repetitive tasks.</p>
<p>For example, you may be working on a project that uses Amazon VPCs, Amazon EC2 instances, and Amazon RDS databases. In the course of your testing, you find that every time you create a Amazon VPC, spin up a server, and deploy a database, the configuration is the same. You always choose the same instance and database type, with the same options selected, using the same security groups, in subnets with the same NACL configuration. You don’t want to have to go through the same manual process every time you want to re-create your test conditions.</p>
<p>You can use Amazon Q’s Console-to-Code feature to automate a workflow instead of performing it manually every time. First, you activate Console-to-Code in the Amazon EC2 console. Then, Amazon Q records your actions as you go through the process of configuring and launching your instance. Finally, Amazon Q provides you with code, in a language of your choice, that automates the process you just performed.</p>
