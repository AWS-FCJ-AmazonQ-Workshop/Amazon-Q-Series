You might not know where to locate relevant information about your resources, or you might be in one service console and want to access information about another service’s resources without disrupting your workflow.\nAmazon Q Developer answers your natural language questions about resources and provides deep links to those resources so you can quickly find them. You can ask Amazon Q to list a type of resource in your account, for details about a specific resource, or to list resources based on a criteria such as region or state.\nFor example, you may want to know how many Amazon EC2 instances you currently have running. In that case, you can ask Amazon Q your question in natural language, and it will provide an answer based on your specific resources.\nUse Amazon Q in the AWS Console Mobile Application Amazon Q is integrated with the AWS Console Mobile Application to answer questions about AWS. You configure access the same way that you get access to Amazon Q in the AWS Management Console.\nDiagnosing console errors In the AWS Management Console, Amazon Q Developer can diagnose common errors you receive while working with AWS services, such as insufficient permissions, incorrect configuration, and exceeding service limits.\nCompute Choosing Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances With so many Amazon EC2 instance types available, finding the right instance types for your workload can be time-consuming and complex. The Amazon Q instance type selector considers your use case, workload type, CPU manufacturer preference, and how you prioritize price and performance, as well as additional parameters that you can specify. It then uses this data to provide suggestions and guidance for Amazon EC2 instance types that are best suited to your new workloads.\nDatabases Writing database queries with natural language Amazon Q generative SQL uses generative AI to analyze user intent, query patterns, and schema metadata to identify common SQL query patterns directly within Amazon Redshift, accelerating the query authoring process for users and reducing the time required to derive actionable data insights.\nNetworking and content delivery Analyzing network troubleshooting You can use Amazon Q to help you diagnose network connectivity issues for applications that run in your Amazon VPCs. Amazon Q network troubleshooting can understand natural language queries, and works with Reachability Analyzer to provide relevant responses. With Amazon Q, you can ask network reachability questions in a conversational format.\nDeveloper tools Ask Amazon Q Developer questions about building at AWS and for assistance with software development. Amazon Q can explain coding concepts and code snippets, generate code and unit tests, and improve code, including debugging or refactoring.\nDeveloping code features After you explain, in natural language, the feature that you want to develop, Amazon Q can use the context of your current project to generate an implementation plan and the accompanying code. Amazon Q can help you build AWS projects or your own applications.\nGetting inline code suggestions Amazon Q provides you with code recommendations in real time. As you write code, Amazon Q automatically generates suggestions based on your existing code and comments.\nChatting about code in IDEs Within integrated development environments (IDEs), Amazon Q can answer questions related to the software development process, including conceptual questions about programming and how specific code works.

You can get the related shell command that reduces the need to search for or remember syntax. With Amazon Q, you can receive command suggestions as you type in the terminal\nApplication integration Writing scripts to automate AWS services You may know exactly what to do with your AWS resources, and you may find yourself taking the same actions repeatedly. In that case, you can ask Amazon Q to write code that will automate the repetitive tasks.\nFor example, you may be working on a project that uses Amazon VPCs, Amazon EC2 instances, and Amazon RDS databases. In the course of your testing, you find that every time you create a Amazon VPC, spin up a server, and deploy a database, the configuration is the same. You always choose the same instance and database type, with the same options selected, using the same security groups, in subnets with the same NACL configuration. You don’t want to have to go through the same manual process every time you want to re-create your test conditions.\nYou can use Amazon Q’s Console-to-Code feature to automate a workflow instead of performing it manually every time. First, you activate Console-to-Code in the Amazon EC2 console. Then, Amazon Q records your actions as you go through the process of configuring and launching your instance. Finally, Amazon Q provides you with code, in a language of your choice, that automates the process you just performed.\nWriting ETL scripts and integrating data AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service that makes it easy for analytics users to discover, prepare, move, and integrate data from multiple sources.\nAmazon Q data integration in AWS Glue includes the following capabilities:\nChat – Amazon Q data integration in AWS Glue can answer natural language questions in English about AWS Glue and data integration domains like AWS Glue source and destination connectors, AWS Glue ETL jobs, Data Catalog, crawlers and AWS Lake Formation, and other feature documentation, and best practices.
