# Getting started with Amazon Q Developer

### What is Amazon Q Developer?

Amazon Q Developer is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) powered conversational assistant that can help you understand, build, extend, and operate AWS applications. You can ask questions about AWS architecture, your AWS resources, best practices, documentation, support, and more. Amazon Q is constantly updating its capabilities so your questions get the most contextually relevant and actionable answers.

When used in an integrated development environment (IDE), Amazon Q provides software development assistance. Amazon Q can chat about code, provide inline code completions, generate net new code, scan your code for security vulnerabilities, and make code upgrades and improvements, such as language updates, debugging, and optimizations.

Amazon Q is powered by Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service that makes foundation models (FMs) available through an API. The model that powers Amazon Q has been augmented with high quality AWS content to get you more complete, actionable, and referenced answers to accelerate your building on AWS.
