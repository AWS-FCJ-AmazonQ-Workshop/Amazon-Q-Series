#### Overview of Amazon Q Developer

Amazon Q Developer is a next-generation AI assistant for developers, designed to accelerate and optimize the entire software development lifecycle. Built on Amazon Bedrock, Q Developer supports developers from coding, refactoring, testing, to upgrading apps on AWS – all automatically and intelligently[\[1\]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/what-is.html).

Q Developer deeply integrates with popular IDEs like Visual Studio Code, JetBrains, and even the CLI, allowing you to code directly with multi-line code suggestions, real-time AI chat, and natural bash support[\[2\]](https://www.maginative.com/article/amazon-unveils-q-developer-bringing-generative-ai-to-boost-software-development-productivity/).

#### Key Features

- **Chat:** Supports Q&A about code, code explanation, refactoring, generating new code from scratch, and consulting on AWS, architecture, and best practices. Usable directly in IDE, CLI, or web[\[1\]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/what-is.html)[\[2\]](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/).
- **Explore:** Query and explore AWS resources, filter and ask questions in natural language (mainly on web/AWS Console)[\[1\]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/what-is.html).
- **Suggestions (Code Completion):** Smart code suggestions, automatically proposing code as you type in IDE or CLI, saving time and reducing errors[\[1\]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/what-is.html)[\[2\]](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/).
- **Agent:** Performs complex tasks such as describing, large-scale refactoring across multiple files, creating pull requests, or automating development workflows from a single prompt[\[2\]](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/).
- **Code Scans:** Scans and detects security vulnerabilities and potential bugs in code, explains the causes, and suggests automatic fixes[\[1\]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/what-is.html)[\[2\]](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/).
- **Transformation:** Automatically refactors or upgrades entire projects when changing language versions (e.g., Java 8 → Java 17) or porting platforms (.NET Windows → Linux)[\[2\]](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/).
- **Multi-platform support:** Usable on Web, IDE (Visual Studio Code, JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse Preview), and CLI (MacOS, Linux, Ubuntu)[\[1\]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/what-is.html)[\[2\]](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/).
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** Supports MCP on CLI (update 4/2025), allowing AI to access external tools, data, and APIs with security standards, enabling richer and more customizable development workflows[\[4\]](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/04/amazon-q-developer-cli-model-context-protocol/).

#### Practical Applications

- **Boost productivity:** Companies like BT Group and National Australia Bank report 37%-50% code suggestion acceptance, with productivity increases of 20-40%[\[3\]](https://www.missioncloud.com/blog/what-is-amazon-q-and-how-does-it-unlock-productivity-for-businesses-and-developers).
- **Upgrade & migrate app:** Automatically upgrade Java versions, port .NET, saving time and reducing costs.
- **Optimize AWS:** Analyze cost, architecture, and AWS operations efficiently via chat and in-depth recommendations.
- **Generate docs & diagrams:** Automatically generate flowcharts, class diagrams, and sequence diagrams to understand systems[\[5\]](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/dotnet/generate-code-documentation-using-amazon-q-developer/).
