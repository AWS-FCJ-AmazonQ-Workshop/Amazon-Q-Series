#### Best practices for onboarding

- **Start with Free Tier:** Register an AWS Builder ID to experience basic features and get familiar with Amazon Q Developer at no cost [[1]](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/getting-started/) [[6]](https://community.aws/content/2fVw1hN4VeTF3qtVSZHfQiQUS16/getting-started-with-amazon-q-developer-in-visual-studio-code?lang=en).
- **Provide clear context:** When chatting or making AI requests, provide enough information about your project, goals, and constraints to get accurate results.
- **Leverage inline suggestions & chat:** Combine code completion and inline chat to code faster and get answers directly in your IDE.
- **Read docs & tutorials carefully:** Refer to official documentation and AWS video guides to understand installation and usage workflows [[3]](https://aws.amazon.com/awstv/watch/d2a2b019175/) [[5]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0zQpJPfSdU).
- **Manage access permissions:** Set up IAM properly to protect data and control costs when using Amazon Q in enterprise environments.
