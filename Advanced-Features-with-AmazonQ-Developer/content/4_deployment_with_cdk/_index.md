In this lab, you'll learn how to deploy your application to AWS using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) with Amazon Q Developer's assistance. You'll create a deployment that uses Amazon S3 for hosting your static files and Amazon CloudFront for content delivery, transforming your local web application into a globally distributed, production-ready solution.

#### Prerequisites

{{% notice note %}}
Ensure you have completed [Environment Setup](2_invironment_setup/) and have Amazon Q Developer properly configured in both CLI and IDE environments.

#### Lab Overview

This lab demonstrates the power of combining Amazon Q Developer with AWS CDK to:

- **Generate Infrastructure Code** - Create AWS CDK applications using AI assistance
- **Deploy Cloud Resources** - Launch S3 buckets, CloudFront distributions, and related services
- **Manage Deployments** - Update and maintain your cloud infrastructure
- **Visualize Architecture** - Generate diagrams of your deployed resources
- **Follow Best Practices** - Implement secure, scalable deployment patterns

#### What You'll Build

Your deployment architecture will include:

- **Amazon S3 Bucket** - Secure static website hosting with proper configurations
- **Amazon CloudFront Distribution** - Global CDN for fast content delivery
- **AWS CDK Stack** - Infrastructure as code for repeatable deployments
- **IAM Roles and Policies** - Secure access controls
- **Custom Domain** (Optional) - Professional URL for your application

#### What You'll Learn

By completing this lab, you will:

- ✅ **Master CDK with AI** - Generate infrastructure code using Amazon Q Developer
- ✅ **Deploy to Production** - Launch applications on AWS with enterprise-grade setup
- ✅ **Understand Cloud Architecture** - Learn how S3 and CloudFront work together
- ✅ **Manage Infrastructure** - Update, monitor, and troubleshoot deployments
- ✅ **Create Documentation** - Generate architecture diagrams and deployment guides
- ✅ **Optimize Performance** - Configure CDN settings for optimal user experience

#### Lab Structure

[4.1 Creating AWS CDK Infrastructure with Amazon Q](1_cdk_creation/): Generate complete CDK infrastructure code using natural language prompts, including S3 bucket configuration, CloudFront distribution setup, and security policies.

[4.2 Deploying AWS Resources using CDK](2_resource_deployment/): Execute the deployment process, understand the AWS resource creation sequence, and verify successful deployment with Amazon Q's guidance.

[4.3 Exploring and Managing Deployed Resources](3_resource_exploration/): Navigate the AWS Console, understand resource relationships, and learn to manage your deployed infrastructure using Amazon Q Developer.

[4.4 Generating Architecture Diagrams](4_architecture_diagram/): Create professional architecture diagrams that document your deployment and can be used for presentations or documentation.

#### Key Benefits of This Approach

**Infrastructure as Code**: Version-controlled, repeatable deployments that can be easily modified and redeployed

**Global Performance**: CloudFront CDN ensures fast loading times worldwide with edge locations

**Cost Efficiency**: Pay-only-for-what-you-use model with AWS Free Tier eligibility for new accounts

**Security**: Built-in AWS security features including encryption, access controls, and DDoS protection

**Scalability**: Automatic scaling to handle traffic spikes without manual intervention

**AI-Assisted Development**: Amazon Q Developer accelerates the entire deployment process
