#### Introduction to Advanced Features with Amazon Q Developer

Welcome to the **Amazon Q Developer Advanced Features Workshop**, where we'll explore cutting-edge capabilities that transform how developers build, deploy, and manage cloud applications. This hands-on session is designed to unlock the full potential of Amazon Q Developer's **agentic capabilities** and advanced automation features[[1]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/features.html)[[2]](https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/06/amazon-q-developer-agent/).

#### Workshop Overview

In today's rapidly evolving development landscape, **Amazon Q Developer** has emerged as the most capable generative AI-powered assistant for software development[[3]](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/), offering unprecedented productivity gains with acceptance rates reaching up to 50%[[4]](https://www.maginative.com/article/amazon-unveils-q-developer-bringing-generative-ai-to-boost-software-development-productivity/). This workshop goes beyond basic code suggestions to explore advanced features that can **revolutionize your entire development workflow**[[1]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/features.html)[[2]](https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/06/amazon-q-developer-agent/).

#### What You'll Experience

**Advanced Agent Capabilities**
You'll discover how Amazon Q Developer's **multi-turn conversational abilities** enable dynamic, context-aware interactions throughout your development process[[5]](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/05/amazon-q-developer-agentic-coding-experience-ide/)[[6]](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/introducing-the-enhanced-command-line-interface-in-amazon-q-developer/). The new **agentic coding experience** allows Amazon Q to perform complex tasks autonomously, from implementing features to generating documentation and creating comprehensive test suites[[2]](https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/06/amazon-q-developer-agent/)[[7]](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/features/).

**Streamlined Cloud Operations**
Learn to leverage **Amazon Q CLI** capabilities for simplified cloud operations, including VPC traffic analysis, network troubleshooting, and infrastructure automation[[8]](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/06/agentic-capabilities-amazon-q-developer-chat-aws-management-console-chat-applications/)[[9]](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/06/agentic-capabilities-amazon-q-developer-chat-aws-management-console-chat-applications). The workshop demonstrates how Amazon Q can automatically gather relevant CloudWatch logs, examine configurations, and analyze recent changes across your AWS environment[[8]](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/06/agentic-capabilities-amazon-q-developer-chat-aws-management-console-chat-applications/).

**Infrastructure as Code Mastery**
Explore advanced **AWS CDK deployment patterns** and learn how to create architecture diagrams, manage multi-file operations, and implement autonomous planning strategies[[10]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/deploy.html)[[11]](https://cdkworkshop.com/). You'll see how Amazon Q can generate CDK code, deploy resources, and create comprehensive documentation[[12]](https://dev.to/aws-builders/aws-cloud-path-week-8-completing-aws-101-workshop-with-cdk-4j4i)[[13]](https://www.classcentral.com/course/lab-deploying-a-cicd-pipeline-with-a-managed-deployment-stage-using-aws-cdk-391400).
