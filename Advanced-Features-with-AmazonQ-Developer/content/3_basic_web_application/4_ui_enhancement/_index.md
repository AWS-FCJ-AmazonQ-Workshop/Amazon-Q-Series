#### Step 1: Understanding Advanced Prompting Techniques

Before we start enhancing our application, let's understand some principles of effective prompting with Amazon Q:

1. **Be specific and detailed:** Provide context, requirements, and constraints
2. **Break down complex tasks:** Ask for one feature at a time
3. **Iterative refinement:** Start with a basic implementation, then ask for improvements
4. **Provide examples:** When possible, show examples of what you want
5. **Ask for explanations:** Request explanations of how the code works

#### Step 2: Enhancing the UI with Detailed Prompts

**1.** Use a detailed prompt to enhance the UI (IDE or CLI):

```
I want to enhance my Sudoku game UI with the following features:
1. A modern, clean design with a color scheme that reduces eye strain
2. A responsive layout that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
3. Verify grid layout display.
4. Visual feedback for selected cells, valid/invalid entries, and completed rows/columns/boxes
5. A game info panel showing:
   - Current difficulty level
   - Timer
   - Number of mistakes
   - Completion percentage
6. Animations for cell selection and number placement
7. Support for both mouse and keyboard input
```

**2.** Review the result

#### (Optional) Step 3: Refining and Optimizing with Iterative Prompts

After implementing the enhanced features, you can use Amazon Q to help refine and optimize your code:

**1.** For performance optimization:

```
I've implemented the enhanced Sudoku game, but I'm concerned about performance, especially:

1. The solver algorithm seems slow on difficult puzzles
2. There's a noticeable delay when validating the board after each input
3. The UI becomes less responsive when using the visualization feature

Please suggest optimizations to improve performance while maintaining functionality.
```

**2.** For code quality and organization:

```
I want to improve the organization and maintainability of my Sudoku game code:

Current issues:
- The code has grown large and is becoming difficult to manage
- There's some duplication in the validation and generation logic
- Event handlers are getting complex with multiple responsibilities

Please suggest how I can:
1. Refactor the code using appropriate design patterns
2. Separate concerns (UI, game logic, state management)
3. Improve code readability and maintainability
4. Add proper error handling
```

#### (Optional) Step 4: Testing Your Enhanced Application

**1.** Test all the new features you've implemented

**2.** If you encounter any issues, use Amazon Q to help debug:

```
"I'm having an issue with [specific feature]. Here's the error I'm seeing: [error details].
Here's the relevant code: [paste code]. How can I fix this?"
```

#### Next Steps

Congratulations! You've enhanced your Sudoku web application using advanced prompting techniques with Amazon Q Developer. Your application now has more sophisticated features and a better user experience.

In the next lab, you'll learn how to deploy your application to AWS using CDK.
