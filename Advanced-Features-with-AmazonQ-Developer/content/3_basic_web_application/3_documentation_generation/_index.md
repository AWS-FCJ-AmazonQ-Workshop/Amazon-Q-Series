**1.** In CLI or IDE, we will use Q Developer to generate README.md by prompt

```
Could you create a README file for this application?
```

**2.** Review the result

#### (Optional) Testing and Debugging with Amazon Q

**1.** Open your **index.html** file in a web browser to test your Sudoku application

**2.** If you encounter any issues, use Amazon Q in VS Code or in the terminal to help debug:

```
"Why isn't this code working as expected?"

describe your issue...
```

**3.** Use Amazon Q's suggestions to fix any bugs or improve functionality

#### (Optional) Step 5: Adding Final Touches

**1.** Use Amazon Q to help you add final touches to your application:

**Ask Amazon Q:**

```
"How can I improve the user experience of my Sudoku game?"
"Can you help me add a timer feature to my Sudoku game?"
"How can I save the game state so users can continue later?"
```

**2.** Implement the suggestions that you find valuable

#### (Optional) Example Prompts for Amazon Q

Here are some example prompts you can use with Amazon Q to help with specific aspects of your Sudoku application:

- "How do I generate a valid Sudoku puzzle in JavaScript?"
- "Write a function to check if a Sudoku solution is valid"
- "How can I highlight conflicting numbers in my Sudoku grid?"
- "Create a function to save the current game state to localStorage"
- "How do I implement different difficulty levels for my Sudoku game?"

#### Next Steps

Congratulations! You've created a Basic Web application with the help of Amazon Q Developer. In the next lab, you'll learn how to use more advanced prompting techniques to enhance your application.
