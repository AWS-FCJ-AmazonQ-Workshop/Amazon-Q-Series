Variable Names Standards
Amazon Q Developer understands your intent and provides better suggestions when you use clear, descriptive variable and function names. Good naming is essential for both AI and human readers.

## Why Use Meaningful Variable Names?
- **Clarity:** Makes your code easier to understand for both AI and humans
- **Intent:** Helps Amazon Q Developer infer the purpose of your code
- **Maintainability:** Improves collaboration and future code updates

**Best Practice:** Always use descriptive names for functions and variables that reflect their purpose and behavior.

### Example #1: Poor Naming
If you use vague names, neither Amazon Q Developer nor other engineers can easily understand your intent.

```python
def f5(x, y):
    z = y + x
```

What is the intent of this function? Is it addition, multiplication, or something else? The lack of clarity leads to poor suggestions and confusion.

### Example #2: Meaningful Variable Names
Now, use full, descriptive names:

```python
def calculate_sum_of_squares(a, b):
    sum_of_squares = a**2 + b**2
    return sum_of_squares
```

Or, for more complex logic:

```python
def process_values(y, x):
    y_plus_x_squared = y + x*x
    square_root_of_y_plus_x_squared = sqrt(y_plus_x_squared)
    return square_root_of_y_plus_x_squared
```

Amazon Q Developer understands the intent and provides much more relevant suggestions.

## Key Takeaways
- Use clear, descriptive names for all variables and functions
- Avoid single-letter or generic names except for simple, short-lived variables
- Good naming improves both AI suggestions and team collaboration
