Considerations

## General Best Practices
Be intentional with your naming and prompt structure. This helps both you and others (including AI) understand your code and requirements. Be specific and descriptive in all aspects of your code and prompts.

### Avoid
- Single letter variable names (except for short-lived loop counters)
- Generic names like `data` or `value`
- Abbreviations like `val` or `num`
- Vague or ambiguous function names

### Use
- Descriptive names like `numberOfStudents` or `totalPrice`
- Names that are specific to the context and type of the variable
- Names that reflect the value, purpose, and scope (global, local, class, etc.)
- Names that indicate the lifetime (constant, temporary, etc.) and visibility (public, private, etc.)
- Prompt directives to emphasize important keywords and guide the AI to the desired response

**Tip:** These are general best practices for coding and prompt engineering. Clear, intentional naming and structured prompts lead to better code quality and more relevant AI suggestions.
