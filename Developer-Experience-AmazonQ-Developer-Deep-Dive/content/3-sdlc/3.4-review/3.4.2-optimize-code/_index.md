Amazon Q Developer can help you optimize your code for better performance and efficiency. This is especially useful for identifying inefficient algorithms and suggesting improvements.

#### How to Optimize Code
1. **Create a new file** (e.g., `inefficientsort.py`) in VSCode and paste in the following code block:

```python
def inefficient_sort(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(len(arr) - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                # Swap elements
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

2. **Highlight the entire code block, right-click, and choose** `Amazon Q Developer > Optimize`.
3. **Review the response.** Amazon Q Developer will explain how the code can be optimized and may suggest more efficient algorithms (e.g., using built-in sort functions or more advanced sorting algorithms).

#### Best Practices
- Always review performance-critical code for optimization opportunities
- Prefer built-in or well-tested library functions when possible
- Understand the trade-offs between readability and performance
