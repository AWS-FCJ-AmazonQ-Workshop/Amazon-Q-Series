Here is one way to optimize the selected code block:

The code is calculating the sum of line items, applying a tax rate, and getting the total. Currently it has some issues:

The for loop is iterating over the length of line_items but accessing elements by index i. This will cause an error since i is not defined in the loop. It should use j as the index instead.
2.Calculating sum, tax, and total in separate statements can be combined into one expression for cleaner code.

Printing each result individually is less efficient than printing them all at once.
Here is an optimized version:

sum = 0
line_items = [{'amount': 0} for i in range(100)]
tax_rate = 0.07
for j in range(len(line_items)):
  sum += line_items[j]

  tax = sum * tax_rate
  total = sum + tax

print(f"Sum: {sum}")
print(f"Tax: {tax}")
print(f"Total: {total}")

To optimize further we could use sum() to calculate the total directly instead of a for loop.

sum = sum(line_items)
tax = sum * tax_rate
total = sum + tax

print(f"Sum: {sum}")
print(f"Tax: {tax}")
print(f"Total: {total}")
