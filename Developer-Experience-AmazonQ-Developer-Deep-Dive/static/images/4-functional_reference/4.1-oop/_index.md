## Object-Oriented Programming: Polymorphism & Inheritance

Polymorphism and inheritance are foundational concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) that enable code reusability, modularity, and extensibility.

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects or methods to take on multiple forms or behaviors. It enables objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass, supporting the principle of "one interface, multiple implementations." This flexibility makes code more adaptable and easier to maintain.

### Inheritance
Inheritance lets a new class (child or derived class) inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (parent or base class). The child class can extend or override the inherited features, promoting code reuse and modeling real-world relationships.

**Summary:**
- Polymorphism enables consistent and flexible code by allowing different objects to be treated uniformly.
- Inheritance supports code reuse and extensibility by building new classes from existing ones.

## Using Amazon Q Developer for OOP
In this section, you will use Amazon Q Developer to create examples demonstrating OOP concepts, focusing on polymorphism and inheritance. Amazon Q Developer can generate class-based code using prompts like:

**Example Prompt:**
> Create a function with classes and objects to implement polymorphism with inheritance. Include country, language spoken, and capital for India and USA as two functions using inheritance.

You can use this prompt in Python, C#, or other supported languages. For example, in VS Code, create a file `polymorphism.py` and enter the generated code.

By leveraging Amazon Q Developer, you can quickly scaffold OOP solutions and explore best practices in modern software development.
